# bitburner
This is a list of scripts I use (or used to use) in bitburner.
All files are provided AS-IS. If you decide to run them and they don't work, feel free to open an Issue. UNLESS the script is in a folder marked "old".

Any script in a non-old folder is tested against Bitburner v1.3.0 (75283504).
