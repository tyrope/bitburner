# bitburner
This is a list of scripts I use (or used to use) in bitburner.
All files are provided AS-IS. If you decide to run them and they don't work, feel free to open an Issue. UNLESS the script is in a folder marked "old".
Feedback? Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR.

(This used to say all scripts are tested, but hahaha no they're not.)
